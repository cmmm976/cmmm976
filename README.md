# Data Science Projects

## [OWR Predictor](https://github.com/cmmm976/OWREstimator)
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://bit.ly/TASPredictor)

This is a personal project in which I created a web application to predict of the minimum duration of a video game session.

Stack : **Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, beautiful soup, flask, streamlit)**

* Developed a web application that estimates the minimum duration of a match within a 6-minute margin
* Extracted 6,000+ game sessions' data from APIs and web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
* Created new variables based on game session time, number of players, and the game's release year
* Built an API using Flask and the web application using Streamlit

## [Predicting NYC Taxi Fare](https://github.com/cmnemoi/NYCTaxiFareLPSID)
Data Science project of Lille's Bachelor of Economics, which consists of participating in the Kaggle competition [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction).

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://cmnemoi-nyc-taxi-fare.streamlit.app/)

* Developed a web application that estimates the price of a ride within a $1.4 range
* Cleaned and analyzed a dataset with 340,000+ rows to remove outliers and noise from data with normalization
* Created new variables based on ride duration and destinations
* Built the web application using Streamlit

# Data Analytics projects

## [Lyrics Explorer](https://github.com/cmmm976/LyricsExplorator)

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://bit.ly/LyricsExplorer)

A web app allowing you to compare French Hip-Hop lyrics.

Stack : **Python (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, LyricsGenius, SQLAlchemy), MySQL, AWS RDS**

* 21723 songs collected through LyricsGenius API
* MySQL database hosted on a AWS RDS DB instance
* Nice looking charts automatically generated from data and user entries
* Web app with Streamlit

# Other

## [cmnemoi-learn](https://github.com/cmnemoi/cmnemoi-learn)

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cmnemoi-learn.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cmnemoi-learn) 

`cmnemoi-learn` is a reimplementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch (using only `numpy`) with high quality development practices :
- unit testing with `pytest`
- code quality checking with `black`, `pylint` and `mypy`
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to version and publish the package automatically to PyPI

## [Eternaltwin](https://gitlab.com/eternaltwin)

Eternaltwin is an open-source project created to preserve and recreate Motion Twin games, a 20-year old indie video game studio which released 25+ Web/Flash-based games.

I help as an eMush contributor and with DevOps contributions : [Docker](https://gitlab.com/eternaltwin/kadokadeo/kadokadeo/-/merge_requests/2) and [CI pipelines](https://gitlab.com/eternaltwin/kingdom/kingdom/-/merge_requests/114) setups for other projects.

### [eMush](https://github.com/cmnemoi/eMush/)

Stack : **PHP 8.3 (Symfony 6.2, PHPUnit, Codeception), Vue.js 3, PostgreSQL, GitLab, Docker, GitLab CI**

KPIs : 
- 1500+ users (100+ daily)
- contribution to 80 000+ lines of code

Missions :
- feature development, bugfixes and testing
- enhancement of CI pipelines
- implementing good practices (TDD, BDD, Clean Architecture)
- participation in discussions on project direction and features to be developed
- writing monthly news and patchnotes
- animating alpha tests
