* Extracted 3800+ game runs from Speedrun.com using its API and Python.
* Scrapped 2000+ game runs from TASvideos using Beautiful Soup and Python.
* Engineering features from the time of the world records, number of runners and released year for each game put on Python, Libre Office Calc/Excel and Streamlit.
* Optimized linear, lasso, ridge, random forest, gradient boost regressor using GridSearchCV to find the best model.
* Built the web app using Streamlit.
