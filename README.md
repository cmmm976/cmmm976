# Data Science Projects

## [OWR Predictor](https://github.com/cmmm976/OWREstimator)
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://bit.ly/TASPredictor)

This is a personal project in which I created a web application to predict the best possible time for a game speedrun.

Stack : **Python 3.9, pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, beautiful soup, flask, streamlit, joblib**

* Created a web app that estimates the best possible time of a speedrun (MAE ~ 388 seconds).
* Extracted 3800+ game runs from Speedrun.com using its API and Python.
* Scrapped 2000+ game runs from TASvideos using Beautiful Soup and Python.
* Engineering features from the time of the world records, number of runners and released year for each game put on Python, Libre Office Calc/Excel and Streamlit.
* Optimized linear, lasso, ridge, random forest, gradient boost regressor using GridSearchCV to find the best model.
* Built the web app using Streamlit.

## [YT Channel data analysis](https://github.com/cmmm976/LinearRegressionsYTChannel)

A school project in which I decided to analyse the data of my Youtube channel.

Stack : **R, Python, LateX**

* Found that likes predicts very well the number of views (R¬≤ = 0.91)
* Wrote of a report of 16 pages showing how I collected the data, which variables I chose to analyse, the methods used, the limits and problems encountered and possible improvements
* Collected 1 year of data from the Youtube Channel using Youtube API
* Analyzed 5 variables : number of views, likes, shares, comments, minutes watched
* Built univariate and multivariate linear regressions from scratch in R (least squares method)
* Analyzed the statistics from the regressions : residuals, F-statistic, R-squared to determine the quality of the models

## [TECCO trial analysis](https://github.com/cmmm976/EtudeDeCas)

A school project in which I had to analyse the result of a randomised trial to determine which treatment is better for reparing the Common Femoral Artery.

Stack : **SAS**

* Found that chirurgy is better (AOC = 0.72)
* Engineering features (One Hot Encoding)
* Compared Odd-ratios to determine which features have the most impact on healings as confusion factors
* Ran univariate and multivariate logistic regressions
* Determined which confusion factors to keep in the model with p-values and odd-ratios
* Determined the quality of the model with ROC and AUC

# Data Analysis projects

## [Lyrics Explorer](https://github.com/cmmm976/LyricsExplorator)

A web app allowing you to compare French Hip-Hop lyrics.

Stack : **Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, LyricsGenius**

* 7800 songs collected through Genius API
* Nice looking charts automatically generated from data
* Web app with Streamlit

# Other

## [Eternal Twin](https://github.com/cmmm976/EternalTwin)

Eternal Twin is an open-source project created to preserve and recreate Motion Twin games, a 20-year old indie video game studio which released 25+ Web/Flash-based games.

### [Web scrapper](https://github.com/cmmm976/EternalTwin/commits/popotamo-web-scraper?commit=cmmm976)

I developped a web scrapper in Rust to collect players' data before sites get offline. I learned :
* Rust language
* How to do use and create unit tests
* Git : fork, commit, create branch...

## Misc

[Youtube API call script](https://github.com/cmmm976/ExtractingDataFromMyYTChannel), [PCA charts in R](https://github.com/cmmm976/APCA), [C++/Qt basic desktop app with probability calculus](https://github.com/cmmm976/KillPredictor), [Terminal-based Hangman game in Python](https://github.com/cmmm976/zPendu), [PubMed Presence Plugin in Typescript](https://github.com/cmmm976/PubMedPreMidPresence)...
